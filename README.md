# akz-itemcollector

If you're having trouble patching the item collector, download the backend.exe and backend.md5 files and place them in your item collector directory overwriting the current backend.exe in there. Then run itemcol.exe.

Also, make sure when you do get the item collector running, check the settings and make sure the local db updates only is unchecked.
